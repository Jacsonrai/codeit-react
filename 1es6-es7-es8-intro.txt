What is ECMAScript?

It's like a rulebook for JavaScript. 
When people make web browsers, they need a set of rules so that 
when you write a program in JavaScript, it works the same way no
 matter which browser you're using.

Why was it developed?
To make sure everyone plays by the same rules.
Imagine you're playing a game, and everyone needs 
to follow the same rules to make it fair and fun. Similarly,
ECMAScript was created so that all the web browsers follow the same 
rules when it comes to understanding and running JavaScript code.

In even simpler terms:
ECMAScript helps all the web browsers
 speak the same language when they're 
 running JavaScript code. It's like having 
 a common set of rules for everyone, so developers can 
 write code confidently, knowing it will work properly across 
 different browsers.imagine JavaScript is a language, and ECMAScript 
 is the grammar book that helps everyone understand and use the language in the same way.
